This is how you can download the code from this repository (Team10182) and work at home:   

1. You need 'git' installed on your computer. You can get it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Open a cmd window. Hold down the Windows key and press R, then type cmd. You need to open a new window once you've installed git.

## Vuforia

Team Fixit3491 put together a series of videos that explain how to work with Vuforia. 
All of the info below is from those videos and needs to be validated.

Here's how it works:

1 - You download the object scanner to a phone. Any phone. You get the scanner here: https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/tool

2 - You scan an object. Follow the instructions in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fjpgjViSAY

3 - You upload the object to a web site.

4 - You download the database from the web site onto your PC and add it as a resource into Android Studio.

5 - You write an opmode that detects the object and acts accordingly. See details in Team Fixit 341's videos 3 and 4.

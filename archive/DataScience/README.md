This class teaches the basics of data science in the context of Civic Hacking.

Here is a video introducing the topic of Civic Hacking. It is a great example of something that happened right here in Chicago:

The tools we will be using are:
- the Python programming language.
- Jupyter Notebooks.

We will analyze data sets by writing scripts in Python. These scripts will run inside Jupyter Notebooks. 

You can get Python and Jupyter on your computer by downloading a package called Anaconda.

Instructions on installing Anaconda is here: https://github.com/rwoodley/Team10182/blob/master/DataScience/Week1.md

To run it on Windows:

    Press the Windows key and hit R.

    Then type: jupyter notebook

    This will open a browser and put you at the start page for Jupyter. Click on 'New' and then 'Python 2'.

Then you can start typing in Python commands.

If you want more practice learning Python, you can go to https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python and sign up for free.

Here is a good list of links concerning Anaconda/Jupyter: https://github.com/rwoodley/Team10182/blob/master/DataScience/Resources.md

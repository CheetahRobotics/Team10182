# Getting started with Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Step 1: Installation:
Git should already be installed on your laptop. If not, you can install it from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
You can tell if it is installed by opening a command prompt (*) and typing 'git'. If it says "'gita' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.", then git is NOT installed.

Step 2:
There should be a directory on your C drive already: c:\code\FTC. If there is not one, then create it. (**)

(*) To open a command prompt on Windows, hold down the Windows key and press *R*. Type *cmd* in the little box that pops up.
(**) Open explorer by holding down the Windows key and pressing *E*.

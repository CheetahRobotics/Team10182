# Downloading the ftc_app with git.

The ftc_app is what we also call the "Robot Controller". We will be editing the source code for the Robot Controller to make our robot do special things. 

Open the command prompt (Start/Run/cmd) and type these commands:

    c:
    mkdir code
    cd code
    git clone https://github.com/rwoodley/ftc_app.git

Once you have done that, the ftc_code will be in c:\code\ftc_app.

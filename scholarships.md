This is just a scratch page right now where I'll being to list relevant scholarship opportunities as I come across them:   
- [FTC Page with many opportunities](https://www.firstillinoisrobotics.org/ftc/scholarships.html)

- [CodeHS RaiseMe Partnership](https://codehs.com/info/resources/raiseme)

- [Illinois Commitment](https://admissions.illinois.edu/commitment)

There is no guarantee that these are worthwhile. In most cases I haven't had a chance to even look at them.

#### Missions for 11/10 match:
* We will use the Brian robot in the competition.
* Autonomous phase: just run Omarion's program as-is. We'll get points for going into the crater.
* Teleop: be sure we can get in the crater at the end. If we're able to push some minerals into the depot, so much the better.
* Reminder: here is a quick summary of the missions: https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/ftc/2019/gonemlpg.pdf

#### Goals for 11/8 session:
* Make sure Omarion's autonomous mode works AS-IS. No bells and whistles. Just run as-is and end up in crater. No flag deposit this time. There is no time to work on this now. 
* The robot veers to one side as it runs. A counter-weight should be added to correct this.
* Teleop mode. Make sure the robot can be driven with the gamepad.
* If there is time put a plate or something on the front of the bot so it can push blocks around.

Don't go to the next priority until the previous priority is complete:   
Priority 1: Omarion: Make sure Omarion's program runs. This probably includes adding a counter-weight.   
Priority 2: Nathan: Make sure the Teleop runs with the gamepad. Nathan should do this.    
Priority 3: Benny: Put a bar in the front of the brian-bot so it can push blocks around.   
Priority 4: Practice driving.   
Check in and push all code!   

Other tasks if there are spare hands:
* Finish the other Rev bot so it is a clone of the Brian-bot.
* Keep working on Benny's bot.

The bus leaves the school at 7:30am on Saturday!!!!!

#### Things to remember before Saturday:
* Charge Batteries
* Get a working pair of phones
* Tie up wires so they donâ€™t rub on wheels or drag on the ground, or get in the way.
* Get consent forms.
* We need a flag.

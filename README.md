Things we need to order:
- [Relic Recover Field Kit from Andy Mark](http://www.andymark.com/FTC17-18-p/am-3600.htm). Be sure to order the version with no mats since we already have the mats.

The new Rev Robotics Expansion Hub:

Notes:
 For teams using existing Modern Robotics I2C sensors, because the Expansion Hub uses a 3.3V logic-level while the Modern Robotics sensors use a 5V logic-level. A team will need to use a special adapter cable with a logic-level converter included that will allow their 5V Modern Robotics I2C sensors to be used with the new Expansion Hub. Teams will be able to purchase the cables and adapters through the FIRST storefront. 

For the other Modern Robotics sensors (touch sensor and optical distance sensor) the REV Robotics Expansion Hub kit will include 3.3V alternative sensors that work directly with the Expansion Hub.

Teams also have the option of using their existing Modern Robotics Core Device Interface modules in parallel to an Expansion Hub to connect their existing 5V sensors to their Robot Controller.

#### Building the Bots ####
Each bot consists of 1) a chassis including motors, 2) a set of Controllers, Sensors and cables, and 3) phones and game consoles.

1) For the Chassis we have 2 options.
- Option 1: Use our existing [Tetrix Competition Set](https://www.pitsco.com/TETRIX-FTC-Competition-Set/&TXredir=1).
- Option 2: Use the new [REV Extension Kit](http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-45-1270/) ([parts list])(http://www.revrobotics.com/content/docs/REV-45-1270-PL.pdf), 

2) For the Electronics and cables we also have 2 options:
- Option 1: Use our existing Modern Robotics [Controllers](https://modernroboticsinc.com/robot-electronics-bundle-2) and [Sensors](https://modernroboticsinc.com/sensors). 
- Option 2: Use the new REV [electronics](http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-for-ftc/electronics/control-system/) and [sensors](http://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/electronics/sensors/) and [cables](http://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/electronics/cables/). This [video] shows how to wire up the REV electronics.


3) We have plenty of phones and game consoles from previous seasons.

Building Guides:
- Here is a [guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/basic-bot-guide-tetrix.pdf) to build a simple Tetrix robot chassis using the Tetrix set with REV Electronics.
- Here is a [guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/basic-bot-guide-rev.pdf) to build a simple robot chassis using the REV set and REV Electronics.
- Here is a [guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/basic-bot-guide-tetrix-part2.pdf) to a more advanced Tetrix bot that is suited for Rover Ruckus.
None of those guides use the Modern Robotics electronics, but they are allowed this season. REV seems simpler, but we may not have all the parts.

Notes:
 For teams using existing Modern Robotics I2C sensors, because the Expansion Hub uses a 3.3V logic-level while the Modern Robotics sensors use a 5V logic-level. A team will need to use a special adapter cable with a logic-level converter included that will allow their 5V Modern Robotics I2C sensors to be used with the new Expansion Hub. Teams will be able to purchase the cables and adapters through the FIRST storefront. 

For the other Modern Robotics sensors (touch sensor and optical distance sensor) the REV Robotics Expansion Hub kit will include 3.3V alternative sensors that work directly with the Expansion Hub.

Teams also have the option of using their existing Modern Robotics Core Device Interface modules in parallel to an Expansion Hub to connect their existing 5V sensors to their Robot Controller.

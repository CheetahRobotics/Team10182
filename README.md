- [Training Document] (https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/files/464313/FTC_SDK_UserMan_v2_2_rel01.pdf). Read this first, it has so much information about how to set up phones and laptops.

Rules Manuals:
- [Part 1](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/ftc/game-manual-part-1.pdf) - These are general guidelines that don't change much from year-to-year.
- [Part 2](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/ftc/game-manual-part-2.pdf) - These are specific to Velocity Vortex.

What is new this year?
- There is a new version of the FTC code, version 2.20. Take a look at the release notes [here](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) (scroll down). Many cool new features!
- There is a new version of Android Studio, version 2.1.3. Before we were using version 1.something. Should be much faster, hopefully.
- Look at the sample op-modes in the ftc_app (see the instructions below). Looks like they have a new computer vision library called Vuforia. (We used OpenCV last year). I haven't had time to look at it, someone should study what it can do.

Other resources:
- Order the playing field and any new sensors we need. See details on the [Hardware Page](Hardware.md)

FAQ:
- I want to start looking at the Robot Controller code in Android Studio on my home PC. How do I do this?
     1. You need Java 8 and Android studio installed. The document linked to above shows you how to do this.
     2. You need 'git' installed on your PC. You can install it here: https://git-scm.com/
     3. You need the source code for the Robot Controller on your PC. Please ignore the instructions in the above document and instead do the instructions which are [here](GitQuickStart.md).
     4. Start Android Studio and click on 'Open an existing Android Studio project' and open the directory you just created.

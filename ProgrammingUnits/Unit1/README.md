Done:
- Android, Git and Java are installed on all laptops.
- Driver Station and Robot Controller are downloaded onto phones from Google Play.
- ATeam phones are configured.

To-Do:
1. Wire up controllers per Part IV of Push Bot manual. Stop at page 16.
2. See if the new set of controllers work with the ATeam phones. Ideally the parts are interchangeable and we don't have to worry about pairing the controllers with the right phones. If not, we need to get out the sharpies.
3. Configure BTeam and CTeam phones:
-- See Part IV: Integrating the Op Modes and Electronics. Robot Controller configuration starts on page 16, Driver Station config starts on page 42.
4. Test.

We are learning the Python programming lanaguage. We are using it inside Jupyter Notebooks. 

You can get Python and Jupyter on your computer by downloading a package called Anaconda.

Instructions on installing Anaconda is here: https://github.com/rwoodley/Team10182/blob/master/DataScience/Week1.md

Anaconda is installed on all the laptops in Mr. Im's office. 

To run it:

    Press the Windows key and hit R.

    Then type: jupyter notebook

    This will open a browser and put you at the start page for Jupyter. Click on 'New' and then 'Python 2'.

Then you can start typing in Python commands.

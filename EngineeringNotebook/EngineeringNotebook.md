This year we will do our Engineering Notebook on git. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists) is a cheat-sheet on how to use markdown with git. It is probably just easiest to edit this page on the github.com website.

These are things judges look for in the Engineering Notebook:
* Team growth and development is documented
* Team leadership and organization is documented
* Team failures and struggles are documented
* Every Team member contributes to the Notebook
* Every meeting has at least one Notebook entry
* Entries include pictures, drawings, and text as applicable
* Notebook is an accurate representation of the Team and journey
* Notebook documents changes in the robot plan, including WHY the change was made.

# One Page Summary

* A brief, one-page narrative about the Team, the school or organization, and an overview of the highlights of the Teamâ€™s season.
* The summary page must point the Judges to pages in the Engineering Notebook that the Team would most like the Judges to consider.

The size of one square according to the rule book is 23.5in.-NO

the time for the robot to travle on square is .989 of a second because the distance in one second is 23.75 so the problem came out as 23.5/23.75 which equated to (.989sec)-NO  

The robot travles 11.78 inches per rotation.

We figured this out by measuring the diamater of the wheel of the robot which was 3.75.
